About Me
- I started IT work in the Army, then moved to the Airforce, where I am temporarily on full-time orders. With both branches I configured Switches and Routers. I feel better with command line at times than GUI interfaces. On the civilian side, I work for the Navy at Bath Iron Works as a System Administrator. Managing helpdesk functions, server maintenance, and documentation updates/SOPs. So far I have loved the IT field because I have been able to branch out and challenge myself. It is such a wide field that I will never be bored.
- I am married with 1 child and 1 dog. My husband works in the medical field and we just recently bought our first house. I am looking forward to making it our home.
